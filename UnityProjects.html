					<p>To learn more about the intelligence that goes into games, I built M.A.P.S (Meek.Aggressive.Player.Smart) with two fellow students at NC State. M.A.P.S is a game made in Unity3D meant to simulate the interactions between different kinds of behaviours assigned to different factions in a simple attack-and-conquer style game. Deciding the way each unit 'thinks' and putting it into practice helped me become thorough in my logical reasoning. Observing the unintended emergent behaviours of the units was fascinating as I saw entirely different playstyles arise from slight changes in the decision making process of the NPCs.</p>
					<p>The video above shows how the Meek (blue), Aggressive (green) and Smart (cyan) units interact with each other, which is a really interesting watch. A behaviour tree representation of one of those factions - Smart - is shown above as well. The code sample shows how one of those numerous actions is implemented. Having control over how each and every unit reacts was a very compelling experience, and was one of the key factors in making me interested in video games.</p>

					<p>This project was a great learning experience for me as we ran through an entire software development life cycle using the Sprint Agile Methodology. Going through each phase working with a team consisting of various perspectives and ideas was super exciting. While this was just academic project that required students to discuss about a problem and propose a solution to it, my familiarity in Unity helped my team come up with a working prototype that closely simulated the concept we were assigned.</p>
					<p>This project gave me a wholistic exerience on working with people who each specialized in wildly different skillsets, and being able to bring them all together for this final product helped me get a feel of leading teams as well as being a part of one. This project simulates the first-person view of a construction vehicle's operator, and the problems faced by them. It was programmed to use a flight controller, which happened to be the closest equipment we could get to the actual vehicles used in the field. Working on a project that placed entirety of its focus on the user taught me plenty on how to understand what the end-user wants.</p>
